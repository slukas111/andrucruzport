          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>My project is about getting to know me as a person and the things I have done up until now. Durring this project I had to think of what I wanted to put on here and how to impliment them into this website project.
            By going over the previous labs I have done I was able to complete this project with little mistakes. If I haven't went over the ebook I would have been stuck on many lines of code.
