         <h1>Bio</h1>
         <p>I was born in the states and my father is in the military. Meaning that we had to move from place to place. The place I was born in was San Diego, California. But was raised around the country. For elementary school
            I went to a school in base where it is called, Mary Fay Camp Pendleton. During this time, I took up martial arts and worked myself up to brown belt.
             I stayed there until I was in the 4th grade where I moved to Pensacola, Florida. <br>
    
            <br>Over in Pensacola I graduated elementary school at Blue Angels elementary school. Then went to Jim Bailey middle school which had the same mascot as Mary Fay which were the Bulldogs.
            Around this time, I finally got my black belt and stopped doing martial arts for a bit to work on my studies. Also, in the 6th grade I decided to play the trumpet. <br>
    
            <br>I then moved to North Carolina and graduated from middle school at Jacksonville Commons middle school. For high school, I went to North Side high school and played for the marching band.
            During my 9th grade year in the marching band, we played the twilight zone opening as our act and got fourth place. While in my 10th grade year, we played Pure Imagination from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where we got first place. Then I moved to Bremerton, Washington. <br>
    
            <br> In Bremerton, Washington I completed 11th and 12th grade at Central Kitsap high school. During my 11th grade year, I chose to take a language class which was Japanese. Then for my senior year the new school was finally built, and the air conditioning worked. However, this was short lived because almost halfway through the semester, covid stopped all schools and did online learning.
            After graduating, I am going to Olympic college to get my associates degree and then transfer my credits to a four-year degree in cyber security. </p>
