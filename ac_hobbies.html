         <h1>hobbies</h1>
         <p>Some of my hobbies include reading books, and playing games. <br>
          <br>The types of books I like are usually fantasy, and manga. Some books that I have read so far are Percy Jackson and the lightning thief series by Rick Riordan.
          However, I have not read the Hero of Olympus series. Another book I have read was a trilogy called No Safety in Numbers by Dayna Lorentz which is about a group of teens trying to survive a virus in a mall with no escape. For manga, I usually like to read fantasy themed and some comedy. </br></br>
          For example, a manga I like to read is Jahī-sama wa Kujikenai by Wakame Konbu which is a comedy about a demon general struggling to regain her power. Another manga I have read was Shūmatsu no Warukyūre by Shinya Umemura and Takumi Fukui. This manga is an action filled fight between gods and humans for survival. </br>
        
          <br>For video games, I usually play mmorpg games, murder mystery, and sometimes competitive games. One of my favorite mmorpg games is a mobile game called Toram Online. Toram Online is an mmorpg where your able to craft weapons, fight bosses and hangout with people from different places. I also like to play a game called Dark Souls which is about the main character being forced to travel the land to relight the flames while poot in an endless loop. </br>
